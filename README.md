Welcome to the Guess My Number project! This is a simple yet fun game where players can try to guess a randomly chosen number within a specified range.

# How to Play
Setup: The game will first ask you to define a range for the number to be guessed. You'll be prompted to enter a minimum and maximum number. This range will determine the possible values of the secret number.

Guessing: Once the range is set, the game will generate a random number within that range. Your task is to guess this secret number.

Input Guess: Enter your guess using the provided input prompt. The game will let you know if your guess is too high or too low.

Feedback: Based on your guess, the game will provide feedback on whether your guess is correct or not. If it's not correct, the game will guide you to adjust your guess accordingly.

Winning: Continue guessing until you correctly guess the secret number. The game will then display the number of attempts you took to guess correctly and congratulate you on your victory!
